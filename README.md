# Hello there. I built this new school/old school CSS/JS thing.

I have been around awhile. I love HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, React, Vanilla JS, script tags, Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, Parcel, Yarn, Bower, NPM, git, jQuery, table layout, clearfix, the blink tag, making fun of IE5, ActionScript, Greensock, Babel, ES6, TDD, React, Vue, Backbone, Knockout, Batman.js, the spread operator, template literals, ftp, sftp, ssh, pipelines, serverless, Lambda, node, HTML5, HTML5 Boilerplate, shtml, GraphQL, REST, JSON, XML, SOAP and especially SOWH. Love it all. I have my preferences, but don’t we all. Oh do we ever.

It is all good. Building stuff is especially all good. You will never be happy with the stuff you built. This is fine and normal. Build the next thing.

So, take a look at the source for this project. It is awesome and it sucks. Maybe you can learn something from it? That would be awesome. That’s why I did it. You can do something better probably. Please do.
